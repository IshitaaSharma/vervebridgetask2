# Big Game Census - Interactive Dashboard

Project Overview:

-This project aims to explore player statistics for the "Big Game" by analyzing various player data, such as birth states, team affiliations, age, and average weight. The interactive Power BI dashboard allows users to visualize where players come from, providing insights into geographic trends and team distributions for major football teams (New England and Philadelphia).


Data Description:

-The dataset includes player details for New England and Philadelphia football teams. It captures various attributes including player name, state of birth, team affiliation, weight, age, and College attended and many more.

Key Visualizations:

-Map Visualization: A global map highlights the players' birthplaces. Team affiliation is represented by color (New England in red, Philadelphia in blue).

-Player Count by State: A bar chart provides a breakdown of the number of players from each state. This helps identify which states contribute the most players to both teams.

-Player Age Distribution: A histogram that displays the age distribution of players, providing insight into the age range across teams.

-Average Player Weight: A KPI that shows the average weight of players from both teams, which is affected by intracting other visualization accordingly.

-Player Data Table: A searchable table allows users to filter and view specific player details such as name, state, and team affiliation.


Tools and Technologies:
-Power BI: For creating the interactive dashboard and data visualizations.

-Esri ArcGIS: Used for the mapping component to display geographical player data.


Workflow:

-Data Loading and Cleaning:
The dataset was imported into Power BI. Necessary data transformations, such as filtering, renaming columns, and ensuring data consistency, were performed.

-Visualization Building:
Map and charts were created to visualize geographic trends, player counts by state, and average player weight and age. Interactive elements were added for filtering.

-Interactivity:
Users can interact with the map to focus on specific states and click on a player's name to view more details. Filters allow comparison between teams or a focus on specific data points such as age and weight.


Key Insights:

-Geographical Trends: California and Texas have the highest number of players represented in the "Big Game" for both teams, indicating a strong football talent pool in these states.

-Team Composition: New England has a slightly higher representation of players from Southern states, while Philadelphia has a more evenly distributed player base across different regions.

-Average Player Weight: The average weight of players across both teams is approximately 243.88 lbs.

-Player Age Range: The majority of players fall within the 20-30 age range, which suggests that teams favor younger athletes who are likely in their physical prime.

-State Representation: States like New York, Georgia, and Ohio are also key contributors of players, though not to the same extent as California and Texas. This shows that football talent is spread across the country, with certain states producing more high-profile athletes.


How to Use:

-Open the Power BI file: Load the interactive dashboard on Power BI.

-Interact with the visualizations: Use the filters and map to explore the data based on your interests, such as filtering players by team or exploring birth states on the map.

-Explore player details: Click on specific players in the table to see their birth state, age, and team affiliation.
